You'd likely be able to debug the Java portion of your Flutter app, but not the Dart portion, and wouldn't get hot reload/restart.\r\n\r\n> But if I try to click on \"Fullter Attach\" instead, it just says it's trying to stabilish a connection with the phone and it never succeeds in doing so.\r\n\r\nThe workflow for Flutter attach is slightly different. You need to click 'Flutter attach', and then launch an app that contains a Flutter view, and navigate to the portion of your app that contains the view. When it starts up, it'll write some metadata to the adb log, which flutter attach is watching for, and it'll then connect to the Dart portion of your app.\r\n",
