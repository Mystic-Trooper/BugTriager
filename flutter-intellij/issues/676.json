Now there are zero indications in the UI that you have any analysis errors.\r\n\r\nIn order to be notified that analysis errors exist, I need to either open the project explorer (and notice the subtle squiggly lines) or open the Dart Analysis panel.\r\n\r\n## Possible solution\r\n\r\nBadge the collapsed Dart Analysis panel with the number (or even existence) of analysis errors.  (This is what we do in Atom, and it's quite effective.)\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n```\r\n[✓] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2016.3)\r\n    • Dart plugin version 163.9166.22\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 0.1.8.1\r\n```",
