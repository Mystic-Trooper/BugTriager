Once the flutter daemon (or flutter tool) starts an app in release mode (i.e. Run button launch) then it is done with the app. It cannot stop it.\n\nWhat we really should do here is disable the Stop and Pause buttons (along with Hot Reload, Restart, Observatory).\n\n@mit-mit There are a few known issues regarding buttons and keystrokes that should be disabled but are not yet getting disabled. I believe all of them are blocked on flutter/flutter#6400 and will not be fixed before the release. That includes #332 and #334 and this one. I think it would be good to add a paragraph to the known issues doc informing customers that they need to wait a bit after clicking a button, or pressing a keystroke that does the same thing as clicking a button, in order to give flutter time to finish the action before attempting something else. Just say we know that's not ideal and are working on it.\n",
