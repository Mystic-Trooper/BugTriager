    "body": "From #233, @stevemessick notes:\n\n> With the latest version you cannot continue working on a project that was created with an earlier version of the Flutter plugin. The problem is that we only recently started marking Flutter projects with a module type and old projects do not have that. The solution is to create a new project pointing to the same source directory, and overwrite existing files (.idea, *.iml). The symptom is that there is no device selector in the tool bar.\n\nFWIW, the Dart plugin supports this in it's preference page.\n\n<img width=\"789\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-10-19 at 9 32 29 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/67586/19527949/f40d56aa-95de-11e6-9f06-6e7fcae7c463.png\">\n\nDepending on how we settle #329, we might consider doing something similar.\n\n/cc @alexander-doroshko  \n",
