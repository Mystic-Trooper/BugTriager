Currently, you can easily extract these as a method in the current class using the \"extract method\" action. However, I often find myself creating a StatelessWidget out of this selection instead of a method and have to do that part manually. It would be very handy if you could \"extract widget\".\r\n\r\nThis would allow you to create a Stateless Widget, with a constructor and fields that match the necessary params. For example, if you extracted a piece of Code, and it required a `Todo` with the variable name `todo`, the StatelessWidget would extract a `final Todo todo` field and a Constructor to match. The build method would return the contents of your highlighted selection.\r\n\r\nAfter creating the class, it would replace your current highlighted selection with the `new MyTodoWidget(todo)`;\r\n\r\nEssentially, this would just be a slightly different extraction than a method.",
