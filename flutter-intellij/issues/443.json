An alternative to using a DAS plugin, would be to contribute some [live code templates](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webide/2012/10/high-speed-coding-with-custom-live-templates/) to the Flutter plugin.  Not as smart since they can't leverage all that the analyzer but maybe in this case that's OK? \n",
