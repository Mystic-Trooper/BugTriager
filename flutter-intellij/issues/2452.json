    "body": "Hey hey :) I've been trying out the new logging view and wanted to provide a bit of feedback wrt copying and pasting logged messages. It's a pretty common task when running into bugs in a larger app where another team might be responsible for the feature you're navigating through and you encounter an error. I might want to create a new ticket with the StackTrace, or paste it into slack for discussion.\r\n\r\n### Issue 1: Use cmd+c to copy a log Message\r\n\r\n  1. Enable new logging view (applies to all of these)\r\n  2. Run the app\r\n  3. See a log message or many messages you're interested in copying \r\n  4. Highlight it and press `cmd+c` to copy\r\n  5. Get output like this when pasting: \r\n\r\n```\r\nio.flutter.logging.FlutterLogEntry@76b5b7da | io.flutter.logging.FlutterLogEntry@76b5b7da | io.flutter.logging.FlutterLogEntry@76b5b7da | io.flutter.logging.FlutterLogEntry@76b5b7da\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorkaround: Secondary-click on the message, click \"Copy asText\". This now produces a result I was expecting:\r\n\r\n```\r\n13:30:48.572 2508 800 flutter.tools Restarted app in 1,230ms.\r\n```\r\n\r\nor with multiple lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\n13:30:48.572 2508 800 flutter.tools Restarted app in 1,230ms.\r\n13:30:47.834 2509 400 runtime.gc collection time 1ms • 26.2MB used of 27.2MB • isolates/21837764\r\n13:30:48.007 2510 400 runtime.gc collection time 2ms • 30.0MB used of 31.2MB • isolates/21837764\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Issue 2: Copy a portion of the message\r\n\r\nSay I want to filer down to a specific message. Rather than typing it in (error-prone, sometimes long), it'd be great to copy only a portion of the message rather than \"Copy as Text\" and have to remove the bits I don't want.\r\n\r\n  1. Run app with new logging view\r\n  2. Attempt to select only a portion of the logged message, e.g. I wanted to copy \"Restarted app\" from the message \"Restarted app in 1,230ms.\"\r\n  3. Can't quite see a way to do this\r\n\r\nThanks for all the hard work and community effort on this feature!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
