My usual restart experience happens with the reload in the lower left of the debug pain. So I was thinking instead of the lightning icon, if you could replace it with a refresh or update icon would help me target it automatically. :)\r\n\r\nSomething like this material design update icon might help me aim for the right button. :)\r\n![screen shot 2017-05-10 at 8 11 58 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1326504/25906240/e50e9ce4-3558-11e7-9e53-d0b7a2729eb5.png)\r\n\r\nThanks for considering changing the ui.

I like that explanation...I am coming from Googling during a Flutter 101  presentation and came to this issue when I got confused about the difference.\r\n\r\nhttps://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/hot-reload#previous-state-is-combined-with-new-code\r\n\r\nThat section seems to say the same thing, and I think is pretty clear. Although, I think adding a \"Hot Reload vs. Hot Restart\" section combining all of the caveats would get the SEO up enough that people won't be looking at this issue anymore.",
