Automatically inserting children could possibly create a subtle sense of urgency of coming up with children to fill in the blank. Not sure if that will be felt and whether that's what we'd like to encourage or discourage in the dev flow.\r\n\r\nMy take is that this *definitely* could use some more consideration before we just implement eager generation of empty lists.  Moreover, in the meantime, @sethladd opened another which suggests we do the boilerplate generation if we ask for a completion of the children parameter explicitly (see #832).\r\n\r\n@mit-mit you OK with us closing this out in favor of looking into #832?",

The child is required for widgets where not providing the child would prevent the widget in question from returning a non-null value from its build function. If the widget is a render object widget, then it doesn't have a build function and it can terminate a branch. If the widget is a leaf that builds its own subtree using render object widgets, it can terminate a branch. If the widget is just a wrapper, then it doesn't make sense for it to terminate a branch and it needs a child.\r\n\r\n`basic.dart` is mostly full of render object widgets so most of them don't require a child. The ones you listed are all `InheritedWidget`s, which are used for conveying information down the tree and therefore need a tree to convey the information to.",
