There are several enums with `center`, but because we give compatible types higher relevance, the correct one is always the first.\r\n\r\nDon't pay attention to `CrossAxisAlignment` in the middle, it is still the same hiccup of IntelliJ's attempt to re-prioritize our already prioritized suggestions.
