But so many users were unhappy with it, so some day we introduced an option to show excluded files (gear menu in the Project View tool window header). And a bit later we even made it the default.\r\n\r\nYou may document this gear option: disabling it will hide `.pub` and `build`. Though I'm sure a lot of users will finally prefer to keep `build` folder contents visible.\r\n\r\nAs for the `*.iml` file: it doesn't have to be in the module content root. Your flutter app generator may place it inside `.idea` folder with the corresponding path in `.idea/modules.xml`.\r\n\r\nFinally. Yes, it is possible to implement some hacky magic so that some specific files and folders are not visible in the Project View. But I'm strongly against this magic. I think it would introduce much more confusion than seeing file structure as is.",

However, I noticed that after running a `pub get` they get added to the `.iml` file resulting in that being dirty. Is that expected? I thought the dart-plugin would just filter them out without that in `.iml`.",
