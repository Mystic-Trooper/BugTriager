I'm probably confusing things, but it seemed as though its implementation was asking the analyzer to do something very difficult, due to intermediate states introduced by pushing a widget upwards in the hierarchy.   That's definitely not what I was asking for. Just in case there's any confusion, here's what I was after.\r\n\r\nThe user puts the cursor within the new Text ... 'SHARE' expression and presses some key that means expanded the select to the containing expression (I imagine IJ can already do this).\r\n![screenshot0](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1377460/23774952/1ef69424-04db-11e7-8790-d191f6b3a03a.png)\r\n\r\nHitting the expands-outwards key a few more times selects the 3rd element of the Widget list:\r\n![screenshot1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1377460/23775039/803e898a-04db-11e7-8e4d-009c8ec7b53d.png)\r\n\r\nNow our goal is to move the selected expression around in the Widget list that it's contained in.  Pressing some other \"up\" key moves the entire Flexible expression up one list position.\r\n![screenshot2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1377460/23775222/7a1a8e68-04dc-11e7-9344-93c9d15b34af.png)\r\n\r\nFor the record, this was more painful to do by hand when I first asked for the feature, because trailing commas were not allowed.\r\n\r\n",

I piggy-backed on the IntelliJ Move Statement functionality that is in the Dart plugin.\r\n\r\nAlt-UpArrow does expand the selection to the next level of syntactic structure. But you don't have to select anything; you could just click on 'Flexible' and not select anything to use Move Statement to move the new-expression up or down the list.\r\n\r\nI didn't realize this request pre-dated trailing commas. Yeah, would've been a lot more tricky then.\r\n\r\nThere are also completely different functions, implemented in the analyzer, to wrap a new-expression with another new-expression (re-parenting), and to move widgets up and down the hierarchy. The latter is the one I'm most interested in improving by making it available in more contexts, if that's appropriate.",
