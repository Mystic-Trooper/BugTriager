You do not need any PR to land in the Dart plugin to get this functionality.\r\nTry steps from this issue description, but one line before `title: new Text(config.title),`. You'll see that for this case completion suggestions from the Analysis Server already include trailing commas:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4499789/25436752/f63f5f2e-2a9c-11e7-8a73-e4183fdabc47.png)\r\nI think it would be suboptimal if some trailing commas are provided by the analysis server, but others - by the IDE. I guess you'd better improve flutter-specific completion at server side.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice though that the caret is placed **after** comma on such item selection, whereas the caret **before** comma is expected. This also seems to be a server-side issue. It sends incorrect [CompletionSuggestion.selectionOffset](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/pkg/analysis_server/doc/api.html#type_CompletionSuggestion). `CompletionSuggestion.selectionLength` is normally equal to `0` and this `selectionOffset` is used to place the caret [on item insertion](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-plugins/blob/2553b41ce8a0fb9ada8397ceff06a2cb880076fc/Dart/src/com/jetbrains/lang/dart/ide/completion/DartServerCompletionContributor.java#L357).",
