Put some widget tests within the group\r\n  4. Run the tests\r\n  5. PROBLEMS:\r\n    - Tests are nested an extra level, making them a bit more difficult to read\r\n    - One cannot run `testWidgets` tests individually within a group, only the group itself.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\nRemove the `group` and move tests to their own file. When tests are out of the group, they are displayed properly and can be run individually.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1010\" alt=\"screenshot 2017-07-29 00 03 19\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126604/28738035-8cab1834-73f1-11e7-9e27-8c8e15ccf725.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"741\" alt=\"screenshot 2017-07-29 00 05 47\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126604/28738054-b1922eb2-73f1-11e7-9c70-fae931495840.png\">\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n\r\n[✓] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2017.2)\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 16.0\r\n    • Dart plugin version 172.3317.48\r\n",

I've filed dart-lang/test#426 to track this.\r\n\r\nThat issue was closed as a dupe of https://github.com/dart-lang/test/issues/93 which appears to have been implemented; so I'll open an issue in flutter to see if we can change this. (**Edit**: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/17932)\r\n\r\n(I presume the IntelliJ code is safe if the group disappears, since it's handling other cases where this doesn't occur, like bare `test()`s?).",
