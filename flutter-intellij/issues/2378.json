I'd be glad to share my current branch, which works but needs some polishing.\r\n\r\nThere are some challenges though:\r\na) since android restricts the allowed filenames it's much easier to generate field names accessible in java. Flutter accepts any filename which makes it quite tricky to handle for example filenames composed of characters such as emojis, `@` or `[`. \r\nb) android gracefully handles collisions by overwriting assets when a conflict is found. In flutter we'll have collisions for files coming from different folders, different extensions, and more so for the forbidden characters as mentioned in the point above.\r\n\r\na is tricky but can be tackled, but b needs a lot of thinking on how the developer will access different files with different filenames that would naively map to the same class+field on generated code.\r\n\r\n",

With `r.g.dart`, flutter developer can apply the asset in code by referencing it's asset ID function, such as:\r\n\r\n``` dart \r\nimport 'package:flutter_r_demo/r.g.dart';\r\n\r\n// test_sameName.png\r\nvar normalImageWidget = Image(\r\n  width: 200,\r\n  height: 120,\r\n  image: R.image.test_sameName(),\r\n);\r\n\r\n// test_sameName.gif\r\nvar gifImageWidget = Image(\r\n  image: R.mage.test_sameName_gif(),\r\n);\r\n\r\n// test.svg\r\nvar svgImageWidget = Image(\r\n  width: 100,\r\n  height: 100,\r\n  image: R.svg.test(width: 100, height: 100),\r\n);\r\n\r\n// test.json\r\nvar jsonString = await R.text.test_json();\r\n\r\n// test.yaml\r\nvar yamlString = await R.text.test_yaml();\r\n```\r\n\r\nPS: yes, it is just like the AAPT(Android Asset Packaging Tool) in Android.\r\n\r\n**Up to now, Flr has supported Android Studio Plugin, CLI, and VSCode Extension:**\r\n\r\n1. **Flr Android Studio Plugin** Version\r\n    - GitHub:  https://github.com/Fly-Mix/flr-as-plugin\r\n    \r\n    - Plugin Homepage: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13789-flr\r\n    \r\n    - flr-as-plugin Usage Example Gif: \r\n    \r\n      ![flr_as_plugin-usage-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4953353/75311113-be550800-5890-11ea-85db-d01619623027.gif)\r\n\r\n1. **Flr CLI** Version\r\n    \r\n    - GitHub: https://github.com/Fly-Mix/flr-cli\r\n    \r\n    - CLI Homepage: https://rubygems.org/gems/flr\r\n\r\n    - flr-cli Usage Example Gif:\r\n    \r\n       ![flr_cli-usage-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4953353/75311134-d0cf4180-5890-11ea-9a2f-71d2d5d62e93.gif)\r\n\r\n1. **Flr VSCode Extension** Version\r\n    - GitHub: https://github.com/Fly-Mix/flr-vscode-extension\r\n    \r\n    - Extension Homepage: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LincolnLaw.flr\r\n    \r\n    - flr-vscode-extension Usage Example:\r\n      \r\n      ![flr_vscode_extension-usage-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4953353/75311154-dd539a00-5890-11ea-9b39-79e5f0349930.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

But if we have many resources => it would be good if we can generate those references. (Look likes `R.java` in android world).\r\n\r\nI wrote a simple package to do that in simplest way possible... with build_runner 🥳 \r\n\r\nHere's a detailed article on medium  [https://medium.com/@ishaqhassan/indexing-assets-in-a-dart-class-just-like-r-java-flutter-3febf558a2bb](https://medium.com/@ishaqhassan/indexing-assets-in-a-dart-class-just-like-r-java-flutter-3febf558a2bb)  \r\n\r\nAs well as the package page on pub [https://pub.dev/packages/assets_indexer](https://pub.dev/packages/assets_indexer)\r\n\r\nHope it helps the devs ❤️ ",
